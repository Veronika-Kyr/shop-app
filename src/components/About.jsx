                The main impulse for this plant shop creating was the fact of dieing of the huge part of my plant collection because of war. Some of my orchids, which partially survived, began growing their orchid kids to continue their living. So, I had pretty big quantity of similar small plants and they gave the idea of such a shop. A small home-scale plant shop in memory of my beloved plants, my hobby.
